# Project 7 - Machine Learning

This project is about machine learning. We use linear regression to test and predict temperatures over a period of time.

## How to install and run the project

### Create and Activate Project Virtual Environment

py -m venv .venv  
.venv\Scripts\Activate

### Add and Commit Changes to Github

git add .  
git commit -m  
git push -u origin main

### Add external dependencies

#### Install packages separately from terminal

py -m pip install jupyterlab  
py -m pip install numpy  
py -m pip install pandas  
py -m pip install matplotlib  
py -m pip install scipy  
py -m pip install pyarrow

### Create files

1.  .gitignore
2.  README.md
3.  requirements.txt

### Install and Set up Jupyter in VS Code

1.  Install the Jupyter Extension: If not already installed, add the Jupyter extension to VS Code. This extension provides rich support for working with Jupyter notebooks.
2.  Open the Project Folder: Open your root project repository folder in VS Code. (Usually in your Documents folder.)
3.  Select the Python Interpreter: From the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), select "Python: Select Interpreter" and choose the interpreter from your virtual environment.
    Then create, open, and start a new notebook in your root project repository folder:
4.  Create the Notebook: In the VS Code Explorer, create a new file i.e., yourname_eda.ipynb. Ensure it has a .ipynb extension.
5.  Verify your new notebook is open for editing. If needed, view the project files in VS Code Explorer and double-click the notebook file to open it for editing.
6.  Add a Markdown cell at the top of your notebook with the introduction (include the title, author, date and the purpose of the project).

### Import Dependencies after introduction

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
from scipy import stats  
import seaborn as sns  
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression  
import numpy as np
